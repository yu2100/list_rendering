3. What is the name of the software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?

Answer- Jordan Walke and the company is facebook

4. What are the notable differences between HTML and JSX? Give at least 3 of them

Answer
a. In JSX, a single parent element needs to be returned or it won't compile eg using <div></div> or commonly used "fragment" <></>, while in HTML, you are free to do whatever as you don't have to return a single parent element.  
b. JS can be implemented/written directly in JSX using curly braces {...} whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript.
c. Inline styles are written as objects in JSX with the properties in camelCase, the values in quotes and whereas in HTML, you are free to define millions of styles right inside the opening tag without writing them as objects and putting them in quotes.



5. Why can't browsers read JSX?

Answer
Browsers cannot read JSX because JSX is not a valid JavaScript and there is no inherent implementation for the browser to read and understand it so transpiler is needed to translate it to React.













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
